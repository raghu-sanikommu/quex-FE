            <h2>QUEX - The <span id="headlit">QU</span>estion <span id="headlit">EX</span>change forum</h2>
            <p> This website was designed to increase the productivity of people within an organisation where people can post questions and find answers, all specific to their organisation. With a minimalistic design, this forum provides distraction less authenticated content all specific to you. Say a big 'NO' to 'STRUGGLES' in finding answers specific to 'YOU'. <br>
            It was known for a long time that with no prior knowledge on - What we are currently doing? How should this be done? What must be done in future?  and many 'W', 'H' questions might draw down our productivity. Answers to such questions might be available on Internet but, they might not work/explain the scenario of organisation we are working with. <br>
            QUEX is now ready, that works hand in hand with organisations, providing access to its QUEX forum for authenticated employees/students/customers alone. <br>

## Reason For The Birth of QUEX
* Mr.John, a curious homo sapien is a fresher in an organisation '**O**' and on one fine day, a question '**Q**' related to **O** started hitting him.
* John being a fresher had very few/no connections within **O**. So, he straight away fired up the browser and started searching '**A**' for **Q** related to **O**.
* Clocks' ticking ... 
* John spent fairly enough amount of time and Yes, he found **A**'s! Unfortunately, all these **A**'s are there to explain the situations/scenarios of organisations **P, Q, R** ... but not **O**.
* John felt so sad about it an ended up not finding **A** for **Q** related to **O**.
* Here ended the journey of a curious mind which wasn't able to push new knowledge into its knowledge stack.
* Mr.Candy, friend of Mr.John has been observing all of it from his cabin and **THOUGHT** to help him out.


## Birth of QUEX
* Mr.Candy finally got an **IDEA**! It was to design and develop a website which can be accessed by only people of **O** and post **Q**'s and **A**'s related to **only O**.
* Well, now comes the interesting part, a catchy and self explanatory name for this website ...Oh yeah, here it is, '**QUEX - QUestion EXchange**' forum!
* Candy then started **WORKING** on it day in and out learning skills required to build it.
* Eureka! Candy is successful in developing the _BETA Version of QUEX_ hoping to bring lot more features to it in coming days.
* Candy is going to meet his friend John tomorrow and show him the **INVENTION** he made.
* Lets hope for the best to happen.
